This directory would generally contain results of simulations or real data analyses. Also, intermediate output files might be placed here, cached to avoid having to rerun computationally-intensive steps of the workflow.  -->

This directory contains files of the output. To reproduce the tables and figures in the article. You can source the R file in corresponding directory. For example, to reproduce Figure 3 in the article, you should source the figure3_code.R in /Figure3.
*directory simulation_results contains simulation results which support Table 1-4, Table S.1-3 and Figure 1-2, Figure S.1-2. You can run compDAG.sh to reproduce these results.
*directory realdata_results contain intermediate real data analysis results which can generate Figure 3-4 and Table 5-6, you can run realdata.sh to reproduce these two results.
