This directory contains files of the output. To reproduce the tables and figures in the article. You can source the R file in corresponding directory. For example, to reproduce Figure 1 in the article, you should source the figure1_code.R in /Figure1.
*directory simulation_results contains simulation results which is supported for Table 1-4, Table S.1-5 and Figure 1-2, Figure S.1-2. You can run compDAG.sh to reproduce these results.
*directory realdata_results contain intermediate real data analysis results, you can run realdata.sh to reproduce these two results.
