This directory would generally contain results of simulations or real data analyses. Also, intermediate output files might be placed here, cached to avoid having to rerun computationally-intensive steps of the workflow.  -->

This directory contains files of the output. To reproduce the tables and figures in the article. You can source the R file in corresponding directory. For example, to reproduce Figure 1 in the article, you should source the figure1_code.R.
*directory simulation_results contains simulation results which support Table 1-4, Table S.1,S.3-S.11 and Figure 1, Figure S.1-S.7. You can run compDAG.sh, compDAG_param.sh, hyper.sh, confounder.sh, Multi.sh, cyclic.sh, zero-inflated.sh, lingam.sh, dim&sample.sh to reproduce these results.
*directory realdata_results contain intermediate real data analysis results which can generate Figure 2, Figure S.8-S.14 and Table S.2, you can run realdata.sh to reproduce these results.
