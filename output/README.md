This directory would generally contain results of simulations or real data analyses. Also, intermediate output files might be placed here, cached to avoid having to rerun computationally-intensive steps of the workflow.  -->
This directory contains files of the output. To reproduce the tables and figures in the article. You can source the R file in corresponding directory. For example, to reproduce Figure 1 in the article, you should source the figure1_code.R in /Figure1.
*directory compDAG_simulation_results contains simulation results which is supported for Table 1-4. You can run simulation_code.R and misspecified_simulation_code.R to reproduce these results.
*AML_resuls.RData and MOMS_PI_results.RData contain real data analysis results, you can run realdata_aml_code.R and realdata_moms_pi_code.R to reproduce these two results repsectively.
